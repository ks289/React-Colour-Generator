# React-Colour-Generator
A react based colour generator which given a hex value will generate 10 shades lighter of that colour, 10 shades darker and the colour itself. For each of this the strength of the tint or shade is displayed as a percentage along with the hex value for the colour itself. Additionally, it is possible to copy the colour to the clipboard.
